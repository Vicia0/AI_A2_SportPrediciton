Sports Prediction
Sports prediction is usually treated as a classification problem, with one class (win, lose, or draw) to be predicted. In sports prediction, large numbers of factors including the historical performance of the teams, results of matches, and data on players, have to be accounted for to help different stakeholders understand the odds of winning or losing.

Demonstrate the data preparation & feature extraction process 
Create  feature subsets which show maximum correlation with the dependent variable. 
Create and train a suitable machine learning model that can predict a player rating. 
Measure the performance of the model and fine tune it as a process of optimization. 
Use the data from another season which was not used during the training to test how good the model is.
Deploy the model on a simple web page using either (Heroku, Streamlite or Flask) and upload a link to the video that shows how the model performs on the web page/site.
